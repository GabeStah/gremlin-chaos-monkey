## Alternatives

**(TODO)**: Add introductory snippets for each alternative technology.

- URL: `https://www.gremlin.com/chaos-monkey/alternatives`
- Parent: `Pillar Page: Chaos Monkey Guide for Engineers - Tips, Tutorials, and Training`
- Layout: Model based on [this landing page list](https://instapage.com/blog/landing-page-examples).  A top-level `table of contents` should be anchored to `categories` and `sections` within the content.
- Content:
  - `Intro`
    - What: Describe the purpose of this page as a one-stop resource for a multitude of alternatives to Chaos Monkey, curated and sorted based on the primary technology on which they are based.
    - Who: Explain that the intended audience is engineers looking for alternative solutions to Chaos Monkey that can be used outside of AWS.  Whether the reader knows the specific technology they wish to use, or not, these resources will help.
    - Why: To provide a list of Chaos Monkey alternatives for readers looking to learn, or who may be disappointed in Chaos Monkey's limitations.
  - `Categories`: As listed below, each relevant category (as defined in this spreadsheet) will be given its own `section` with a brief description and overview.  Within each `category section` is all relevant sub-technology `sections`, which will each be detailed as necessary.  When relevant, a given `section` should contain a link to the explicit `/alternatives/<technology>` page, which will provide additional details about the actual implementation of a Chaos Monkey alternatives within said technology.
  - `Additional Chaos Monkey Resources`: In addition to outside resources, _all_ unique pages/URLs found within this guide should be included in this section.  It can later be determined how best to format this, but one possibility is a separate section containing a `site map` link collection.
