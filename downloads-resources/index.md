- URL: `https://www.gremlin.com/chaos-monkey/downloads-resources`
- Parent: `Pillar Page: Chaos Monkey Guide for Engineers - Tips, Tutorials, and Training`
- Layout: Model based on [this resource collection](https://www.helpscout.net/customer-acquisition/).
- Content:
  - `Intro`
    - What: The goal of this `page` is to provide the full list of resources, tools, and other links discovered during research on this project, all of which should be valid and valuable to readers of all kinds.
    - Who: All audiences are intended and welcome, including both technical and non-technical readers.
    - Why: To provide useful resources for anyone trying to get started with Chaos Monkey and Chaos Engineering.
  - `Resources`: Unless otherwise specified, every helpful and properly curated resource should be categorized and included in this list.  Generally, links should not be given any contextual explanation.  Instead, each `category` can include a brief explanation and overview to assist the reader in finding the appropriate resources via a quick scan or table of contents link.  _Note: The following `categories` are not finalized and can easily be modified as necessary.  Additionally, each `category` can be split by resource `type`, such as `text`, `audio`, `video` sub-sections._
    - Blogs
      - `Audio`
      - `Text`
      - `Video`
    - Books
    - Community
    - Conferences & Meetups
    - Discussion
    - Research Papers
    - Social Media
    - Tools
    - Tutorials
  - `Additional Chaos Monkey Resources`: In addition to outside resources, _all_ unique pages/URLs found within this guide should be included in this section.  It can later be determined how best to format this, but one possibility is a separate section containing a `site map` link collection.
