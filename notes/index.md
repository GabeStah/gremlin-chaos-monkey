The following items are assorted things for Austin and/or other editors to take note of and evaluate.

## Images

1. The following `AWS Spinnaker Quick Start Architecture` image, as used in the [Developer Tutorial][/developer-tutorial], is **copyright of AWS**.  If desired, please recreate image for Gremlin.

2. [The History of Netflix Streaming][#netflix-history] section ends with the line "Thus, the Netflix team began their journey into Chaos."  This might be a good place for a "Journey into Chaos"-style image.
3. Currently, the URL `/pdf-download` is being used to reference the future downloadable PDF version of this guide.  Please change all instances of this URL throughout the guide if the target URL changes as well.
4. The following chart is currently used in the [Simian Army - Chaos Kong][#simian-chaos-kong] section and is **copyright of Netflix**.  Please determine if use, with attribution, should remain or if image should be removed.

5. `Janitor Monkey` paint image seen below and used in [Simian Army - Janitor Monkey][#simian-janitor-monkey] is [copyright of Drawception](https://drawception.com/panel/drawing/hJvv6336/janitor-monkey-laughs-at-spilled-mop-bucket/) user [XII](https://drawception.com/player/477070/xiii/).  But, it made me laugh so I had to include it.  Perhaps something similar can be used here for the guide.
