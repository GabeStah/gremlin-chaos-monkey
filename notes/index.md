The following items are assorted things for Austin and/or other editors to take note of and evaluate.

## Images

1. The following `AWS Spinnaker Quick Start Architecture` image, as used in the [Developer Tutorial][/developer-tutorial], is **copyright of AWS**.  If desired, please recreate image for Gremlin.

2. [The History of Netflix Streaming][#netflix-history] section ends with the line "Thus, the Netflix team began their journey into Chaos."  This might be a good place for a "Journey into Chaos"-style image.
3. Currently, the URL `/pdf-download` is being used to reference the future downloadable PDF version of this guide.  Please change all instances of this URL throughout the guide if the target URL changes as well.
