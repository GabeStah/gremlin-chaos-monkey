- Parent: `Pillar Page: Chaos Monkey Guide for Engineers - Tips, Tutorials, and Training`
- Layout: Model based on [this resource collection](https://www.helpscout.net/customer-acquisition/).
- Content:
  - `Intro`
    - What: The goal of this `page` is to provide the full list of resources, tools, and other links discovered during research on this project, all of which should be valid and valuable to readers of all kinds.
    - Who: All audiences are intended and welcome, including both technical and non-technical readers.
    - Why: To provide useful resources for anyone trying to get started with Chaos Monkey and Chaos Engineering.
  - `Resources`: Unless otherwise specified, every helpful and properly curated resource should be categorized and included in this list.  Generally, links should not be given any contextual explanation.  Instead, each `category` can include a brief explanation and overview to assist the reader in finding the appropriate resources via a quick scan or table of contents link.  _Note: The following `categories` are not finalized and can easily be modified as necessary.  Additionally, each `category` can be split by resource `type`, such as `text`, `audio`, `video` sub-sections._
    - Blogs
      - `Audio`
      - `Text`
      - `Video`
    - Books
    - Community
    - Conferences & Meetups
    - Discussion
    - Research Papers
    - Social Media
    - Tools
    - Tutorials
  - `Additional Chaos Monkey Resources`: In addition to outside resources, _all_ unique pages/URLs found within this guide should be included in this section.  It can later be determined how best to format this, but one possibility is a separate section containing a `site map` link collection.

We've collected and curated well **over 100** resources to help you with every aspect of your journey into Chaos Engineering.  Learn about Chaos Engineering's [origins and principles][/downloads-resources#practices-principles] to shed light on what it's all about or dive right into one of the dozens of [in-depth tutorials][/downloads-resources#tutorials] to get experimenting right away.  You might also be interested in subscribing to some of the best Chaos Engineering [blogs][/downloads-resources#blogs] on the net or installing one of the [many tools][/downloads-resources#tools] designed to inject failure into your applications, no matter the platform.

## Chaos Engineering Best Practices & Principles

Without proper practices and principles Chaos Engineering becomes little more than unstructured Chaos.  This section features a collection of the some of the most fundamental Chaos Engineering articles, practices, and principles ever devised.

## Chaos Engineering Community & Culture

A day doesn't go by without multiple people joining the [Chaos Engineering Slack Channel](https://slofile.com/slack/chaosengineering)!  It's an exciting time to hop onto the Chaos Engineering train, but that journey wouldn't be nearly as interesting without the incredible culture and community that has built up around Chaos Engineering.  This collection of resources contains just some of the many awesome aspects of the Chaos Engineering community.
