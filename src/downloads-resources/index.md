We've collected and curated well **over 100** resources to help you with every aspect of your journey into Chaos Engineering.  Learn about Chaos Engineering's [origins and principles][/downloads-resources#practices-principles] to shed light on what it's all about or dive right into one of the dozens of [in-depth tutorials][/downloads-resources#tutorials] to get experimenting right away.  You might also be interested in subscribing to some of the best Chaos Engineering [blogs][/downloads-resources#blogs] on the net or installing one of the [many tools][/downloads-resources#tools] designed to inject failure into your applications, no matter the platform.

## Chaos Engineering Best Practices & Principles

Without proper practices and principles Chaos Engineering becomes little more than unstructured Chaos.  This section features a collection of the some of the most fundamental Chaos Engineering articles, practices, and principles ever devised.

## Chaos Engineering Community & Culture

A day doesn't go by without multiple people joining the [Chaos Engineering Slack Channel](https://slofile.com/slack/chaosengineering)!  It's an exciting time to hop onto the Chaos Engineering train, but that journey wouldn't be nearly as interesting without the incredible culture and community that has built up around Chaos Engineering.  This collection of resources contains just some of the many awesome aspects of the Chaos Engineering community.
